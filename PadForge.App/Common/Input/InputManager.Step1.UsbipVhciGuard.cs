        //
        // Composite USB personas enumerate through the REAL USB stack
        // (vhci → UDE → usbccgp → hidusb). The persona's vendor and product
        // ids are the real controller's, deliberately: Windows has to see a
        // real DualSense for the UAC audio class driver to bind. So its HID
        // interface path carries no HIDMAESTRO fragment, and the serial SDL
        // reports for it is no "HM-CTL-" one.
        //
        // Two things in the device tree do tell a persona from a real pad.
        //
        // HIDMaestro v1.4.3 (HM#42) stamps the ONE node it owns, the
        // emulated host controller, with an additive hardware id:
        //
        //   ROOT\USB\0000  ids = [ROOT\USBIP_WIN2\UDE, ROOT\HIDMAESTRO_UDE]
        //
        // Upstream's id stays at index 0 so driver matching is unchanged.
        // Measured on hardware, the token sits at depth 4 from a persona's
        // HID interface, which is why the walk below is generous.
        //
        // And a persona serves a USB serial (HM#60): HIDMaestro's own, "HM"
        // and twelve hex digits, unless its profile carries a captured one,
        // as the Steam Deck's does. Windows names the USB device by it,
        // USB\VID_054C&PID_0CE6\HM0123456789AB, two nodes above the HID
        // interface of a composite (HidMaestroAncestry.IsPersonaUsbInstanceId).
        //
        // Prefer the token: it names HIDMaestro rather than the transport.
        // The usbip2_ude service check stays as a fallback because the stamp
        // is best-effort upstream (a machine that refuses the write still
        // creates controllers) and because a pre-1.4.3 driver may still be
        // resident. That fallback is the user-mode mirror of the driver's
        // own is_abobe_vhci() check (usbip-win2 drivers/ude_filter/device.cpp),
        // and it matches every device attached through usbip-win2, a real
        // pad forwarded from another machine or another program's virtual
        // pad included.
        //
        // The Switch 2 Pro persona (HIDMaestro 1.11.0, HM#66) is the same
        // shape under Nintendo's identifiers, and the Valve composites under
        // Valve's.
        //
        // Where the stamp is in place, the forks drop a persona before Step 1
        // sees it. The SDL fork drops every HID interface that has the token
        // on its own node or one of the four above it
        // (hid_internal_is_hidmaestro_device at HM_FILTER_MAX_DEPTH 5, called
        // by hid_enumerate and by the RawInput and DirectInput backends).
        // It tests the host controller and not the device, so on a stamped
        // host it drops, with a persona's, the HID interface of a real pad
        // forwarded over usbip-win2 and of another program's virtual pad
        // there. The OpenXInput fork makes the same test on a shorter walk.
        // It gives no slot to an XUSB interface whose own node, or one of
        // the three nodes above it, has the token (IsHidMaestroInterface in
        // OpenXInput's src/OpenXinput.cpp, lines 18 to 83, maxDepth 4 at
        // line 49, asked of every XUSB interface it lists at line 1123). A
        // pad xusb22 serves carries its XUSB interface on its USB device,
        // two nodes below the host controller, and gets no slot. A pad
        // xboxgip serves, an Xbox One or Series pad, carries it on its HID
        // node, four nodes below the host controller, past that walk:
        // OpenXInput gives it a slot, SDL's XInput backend lists it as
        // XInput#N, and PadForge reads it under a stamped host as under any
        // other. A forwarded pad of any other kind reaches Step 1 through
        // none of these backends, and PadForge reads it only by one of the
        // ways below.
        //
        // SDL has other ways in, and no filter stands on them. The fork's
        // GameInput backend (src/joystick/gdk/SDL_gameinputjoystick.cpp) is
        // built into the Windows DLL and asks the filter nothing. PadForge
        // sets neither of its hints. So it lists no gamepad
        // (SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_GAMEINPUT, off by default in the fork), and
        // where the GameInput runtime it needs is installed it lists the
        // Xbox One instruments of its raw-report table
        // (SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_GAMEINPUT_RAW, on by default: the Rock Band
        // guitars and drum kits, the Guitar Hero Live guitar and the Mad
        // Catz legacy adapter of SDL_gameinput_rawtype.h). An instrument
        // GameInput reports reaches Step 1 whatever host controller it sits
        // under, and PadForge reads it. Nor does a filter stand on what
        // hidapi reads through libusb (SDL_hidapi_vendorusb.c: the vendor
        // interfaces of its table, once WinUSB is bound to one, and an Xbox
        // interface the system's own driver does not hold) or on the fork's
        // serial, Bluetooth, network and iCade drivers.
        //
        // A persona does not come in that way. No HIDMaestro profile carries
        // an instrument's ids, and no composite profile has an id of that
        // table or an Xbox interface. The Switch 2 driver, which opens its
        // controller's bulk interface through libusb itself, asks whether a
        // candidate's serial is a persona's (SDL_HidmaestroOwnsUsbSerial).
        // The serial, Bluetooth and network drivers read no USB HID
        // interface, and the iCade driver reads the keyboards whose ids the
        // user names for it, under an interface path this guard walks like
        // any other.
        //
        // So this guard decides for the HID interfaces under a host
        // controller with no stamp, where SDL lists them all: its walk
        // starts from a HID interface path. A device GameInput lists it
        // lets through: the path SDL gives for one is GameInput's device
        // id, which the walk finds no node for, and its ids are no
        // persona's. A pad SDL's XInput backend lists it lets through the
        // same way, under either kind of host controller: its path is
        // XInput#N, and no persona is one, since no composite profile has
        // an Xbox interface. Such a pad's identity is the node
        // StableXInputInstance finds for it, by the rule this guard reads.
        //
        // The persona serial needs no scope and no clock: under the emulated
        // host controller, below a USB device named by it, a device is a
        // persona and is passed over whenever Step 1 sees it. That matters
        // once a persona is detached. Nothing waits for it to leave the
        // tree: usbip-win2 returns from the plug-out as soon as UDE has
        // taken it (plugout_and_delete, drivers/ude/device.cpp) and waits
        // 30 s after one before its own reattach (start_attach_attempts,
        // drivers/ude/persistent.cpp), HIDMaestro detaches and moves on
        // (UsbipBackendHandle.Dispose), and Windows removes the device stack
        // in its own time. A persona still listed after the scope below had
        // lapsed was opened as a controller of the user's.
        //
        // Scope of the ancestry test alone, for a device under the emulated
        // host controller with no persona serial: it holds for the vendor
        // and product id of a composite persona this process has live, is
        // creating, or retired within PersonaRetireGraceMs
        // (ChecksUsbipAncestry). HIDMaestro's USB/IP device emulator runs
        // inside PadForge's process, and a session's persona lives while its
        // controller is connected. One can outlive the session that made
        // it: a session that ended without its exit sweep leaves the device
        // enumerated until the next launch's sweep (App.OrphanSweepTask,
        // HIDMaestro's RemoveAllVirtualControllers, which unplugs it in
        // UsbipBackend.DetachAllOwned). So while that sweep runs, the test
        // also holds for the ids of every composite profile the catalog
        // offers. Outside those two windows such a device is taken for a
        // real or third-party one and not passed over. The residual is a
        // forwarded pad of the exact model of a persona live at the same
        // moment, disposed within the grace, or offered while the launch
        // sweep runs, which is taken for PadForge's own and passed over with
        // a log line. It is passed over only while that holds: Step 1 opens
        // it again once no persona of its ids is in scope and it is still
        // in the device tree (SelfVirtualSuppressions.ReleaseLapsed), where
        // it once stayed out for as long as it was attached. The other
        // residual is a persona with a captured serial, the Steam Deck's,
        // which nothing in the tree tells from a real Deck forwarded over
        // USB/IP: the grace alone covers its way out.
        //
        // The walk meets a second kind of node with a HIDMaestro hardware
        // id, and that one is no host controller. A virtual controller on
        // HIDMaestro's own driver is no persona: its HID interface hangs off
        // a node HIDMaestro creates and gives the hardware id
        // root\HIDMaestro (DeviceNodeCreator.CreateDeviceNode in HIDMaestro's
        // source). No real device sits under such a node, so it is a marker
        // like the HM-CTL- serial: the device is passed over whatever its
        // ids and whatever the scope, and is never released. The walk tells
        // the two kinds by the whole id, the host controller's stamp against
        // every other id that contains HIDMaestro, and it reads the device's
        // own node as well as the nodes above it (HidMaestroAncestry.Classify
        // in the engine, the rule the hiding side and StableXInputInstance
        // read too). It once took every such id for the host controller's,
        // which made that virtual controller a pad over USB/IP: let through
        // unless a composite persona of its ids was in scope, and opened
        // again once that persona's grace had run.
