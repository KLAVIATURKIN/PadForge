"""Mirror captured screenshots into the repo and the website, and FAIL on a gap.

Every stale picture this project has shipped came from a mirror step that
silently skipped something. First it was the PNG-to-JPG `$map` that had no
entry for a new shot. Then it was a loop that only refreshed assets named in
index.html, which left four macro shots showing an empty editor for weeks.
Then it was this script's predecessor printing "no PNG source" for four assets
and moving on, which left screenshot-guide-led, screenshot-nintendo and
screenshot-playstation stale on the live site.

The rule that replaces all of that: every destination is refreshed from a
source, and any destination without one is an ERROR, not a note. A mirror that
cannot explain every file it manages is not finished.

Run from anywhere. Paths are resolved from this file's location.
